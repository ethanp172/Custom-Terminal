# Using commands
To run a command, they are put into different sections.  
`arg1, arg2, arg3, etc`, each arg is seperated by a *SPACE*.  

**Terminal Specific:** `term args`  

# Installed apps
Your CustomTermainl comes with many apps, that can do many cool things.  
To run an app, say `app appName`, for example, *app journal*.  

**Journal**: `app journal`  
The first time you run journal, it will check if the actual journal `.TXT` file is installed, and if not, it will create one for you. Then, it will ask for your journal submission. After confirming to submit it, your submission will be added to the bottom of the journal file.

# Brainstorm
1. Turn the project into a .EXE, and instead of using `./` for the directory, let the user set their own, then init the python files.
2. Add support for 3rd party apps
